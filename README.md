## 📖 Backstory

This project was born out of a real need at **Dharmsinh Desai University (DDU)**. The university recognized the challenges of managing training and placement activities for its large student body. In response, the university sought a custom-built solution tailored to its unique requirements.

The university held a competitive process to select the best students to develop this system. It involved a rigorous test and interview process, and based on merit, our team was chosen to take on this important project. Over the course of several months, we worked closely with the university's **Training and Placement Office (TPO)** to create the **Training and Placement Portal**, which streamlined the placement process for students, TPOs, and faculty alike.

The system was successfully implemented and used by the university for a few years, providing real-world value by simplifying the management of student placements, job postings, and company interactions.

The system ensures efficient management and reduces manual effort in handling placement activities.
